Fibonacci API

## ALGORITHM

I created a Fibonacci API, the Fibonacci algorithm was implemented with memory, which means it will take less time for big numbers. the fibonacci algorithm basically check the fibonacci of (number - 2) and adds it to the fibonacci of (number - 1). Everytime it calculates a new fibonacci it will store it in the memory so the next time it should not calculate the number

## API


Related to API, the API was created with node JS + express with only one endpoint (/fibonacci/:number) it will return the fibonacci number.
